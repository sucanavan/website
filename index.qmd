# Susan Canavan

I’m an ecologist researching biological invasions and the use of digital data for conservation. My work spans species risk assessment, online public engagement, and the development of tools for horizon scanning and biosecurity.

## Current Focus

I analyze digital traces—from geotagged images to social media posts—to study:

- Invasion pathways and secondary spread
- Cultural perception of invasive and extinct species
- Applications of culturomics and iEcology
- Risk frameworks and biosecurity decision-making
