# 👋 Hi, I'm Susan Canavan

I’m an ecologist researching biological invasions, culturomics, and digital data for conservation. I use online data, species distributions, and public perception analyses to improve biodiversity policy and public awareness.

Currently, I’m developing tools to support biosecurity, horizon scanning, and public engagement with biodiversity loss.
