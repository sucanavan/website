The study revealed that human usage, particularly the cultivation of multiple cultivars, is a stronger predictor of bamboo invasions than species traits alone. Traits like rhizome type, culm height, and diameter also correlated with introduction likelihood. The findings underscore the central role of human agency in shaping invasion risk.\n\nCitation: Canavan S, Richardson DM, Visser V, Roux JJL, Vorontsova MS, Wilson JRU (2016) The global distribution of bamboos: assessing correlates of introduction and invasion.
